Implementation:
The implementation of a hash table uses chaining to handle collisions, where each index in the table contains a linked list of key-value pairs. The Node class is used to represent each key-value pair, with a pointer to the next node in case of a collision. The HashTable class includes methods for inserting, searching, and deleting key-value pairs. The hash function computes an index by applying the modulus of the hash value with the table size. Insertion involves placing a new node at the appropriate index or appending it to a linked list if a collision occurs. Searching traverses the linked list at the calculated index to find the key. Deletion removes a node by updating the previous node's next pointer, or adjusts the index if the first node is deleted. The hash table can be printed to show the key-value pairs at each index. The implementation handles basic operations efficiently, but performance may degrade if too many collisions occur.

Time Complexity:
Insert:
Best Case Scenario: Insertion takes O(1) constant time if there is no collision.
Worst Case Scenario: In case of collision it will need to travel along the list giving O(n) linear time for insertion.

Search and Delete:
Best Case Scenario: Value found at the head then takes O(1) constant time.
Worst Case Scenario: In case of needing to travel the list then takes O(n) linear time for searching and deleting.

With uniform hashing it gives O(1+α) where α is the load factor which is the ratio of the number of elements to the number of slots.

Load Factor:
Low load factor contributes to lesser collision hence providing better time complexity and efficieny in the operations.

Strategies for Maintaining a Low Load Factor:
- One way is to resize to double the hash table once it reaches a specific threshold this way all existing keys will be rehashed and it will reduced load factor.
-Other way is to have a hash function that tries to assign keys uniformly rather than unbalancing more values to a key and leaving others empty.
